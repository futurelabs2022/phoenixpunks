PhoenixPunks was jointly developed by Future labs and Japanese artists for NFT works. The Future Labs development team is built on the philosophy of creating an open platform with contributions to the fullest extent possible by the open-source ecosystem. To date we've been able to move extremely fast on our roadmap with this philosophy thanks to our core contributors.

Our team is also comprised of several community moderators, dozens of verified builder partners creating incredible NFT works and community for players, as well as developing more values for holders that request it.​
